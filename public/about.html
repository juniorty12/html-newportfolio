<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I grew up without love, i mean no real family to look after. I was in the hands of stranges people i was not related to. They brought me up. With that being the case, I struggle for a lot of things for a head start. I did not attend primary school , I mean a real one but I found myself in grade 8 where I was determine to go to school. I was not the brightest but iwas deligent on my school work. So I did well and I and finish junior school, senior and higher instution. I wanted medicine and I was accepted at the univisity but at that time I was 85 percent having to take my responsibilities and i had to go in for nursing instead of medicine. I met a middle age woman who I fell in love with but at one point i was not sure if she was the one for me. she was older and sometimes is as if she was mad, I grdually lost interest and at that time I was in england. I work hard as a care provider. At a point, I started to feel like that I need It skills and coding is the one i fell in love with and here I am doing this and I will continue to do this .....</p>
